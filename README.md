(c) 2023 Naoki Masuyama

CAEAC is proposed in:

N. Masuyama, Y. Nojima, F. Dawood, and Z. Liu, "Class-wise classifier design capable of continual learning using adaptive resonance theory-based topological clustering," 
Applied Sciences, 2023.

Run "mainCAEAC.m"

Run "mainCAEAC_I.m" for CAEAC Individual (CAEAC-I)

Run "mainCAEAC_I.m" for CAEAC Clustering (CAEAC-C)
